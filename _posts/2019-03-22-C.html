            <p>Though I had installed a skybox (sky texture usually unavailable) prior to this scene for use in previous scenes, I decided to capture an action scene with appropriate keyframing to create a dynamic showing of gameplay. Proper use of camera rotation helped me convey the battle taking place within the game, alongside applying context towards the pre-battle and post-battle.</p>
