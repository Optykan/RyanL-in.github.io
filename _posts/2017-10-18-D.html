          <p>Having decided on a set theme that I would build my poster around, I worked within my comfort zone to apply bright vibrant colors against a harsh black for a very distinct and flavorful contrast. I used a smoke texture combined with an overlay of rainbow texturing over a cityscape background for a surrealistic final product. My final decorations consisted of choice in sketch-based and ornate font, and fine detailing to transition the harsh colors into a more delicate fade towards the very top.</p>
