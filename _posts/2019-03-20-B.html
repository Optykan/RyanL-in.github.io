          <p>In this scene I set up a pre-determined walk path for two character models, positioning the camera at a horizontal angle to capture the player models as the foreground, and everything else as the background, coloring them black and white respectively. In After Effects, I added rising black ember particles to contract with the background and used masking around the moving model to reveal the text.</p>
